    "Kristiyan is one of the most talented designers I've encountered in my career. Not only is he adaptive to any kind of change, but he's also excellent communicator and someone who never stops learning. His personal and professional skills allow him to work effectively with a wide variety of individuals at many different levels, including approaching difficult clients with the correct mindset and collaboration. As designer, Kristiyan has always been proactive and innovative, while staying on track with the latest design trends Not only that, his willingness to understand every phase of the product development lifecycle is what pushes him out of his comfort zone, which also makes him a very skilled front-end developer. Kristiyan is very dedicated to his work and has a strong work ethic, which makes him a great asset to any team.",

    "Perhaps one of his strongest skills is the ability to share his unbiased opinion in a way that it's not offensive while respecting others' opinions. I consider this as a core requirement for building trust within colleagues at work. By having that level of connection, we were able to discuss and find out the best possible solutions not only for our clients but also for our engineering team so that they can deliver as efficient as they could. Apart from those core abilities he demonstrates excellent design skills - layout, colour and typography, and UX ones such as empathy, research and problem solving. With his unique combination of personality and professional skills I consider Kris as a top talent. Furthermore, I'm sure he will make an invaluable asset to any team and he merits my highest recommendation.",

    "Kris is a very talented person. He is a designer and also a front-end developer with passion. In my opinion, he is a perfect person to collaborate with. I used to work with him on a couple of projects and his dedication was enormous and unique. We have known each other for 4 years as we used to work together. I admire his passion for work and his hardworking personality very much. As I have seen him from very close, I know he can learn things very well and adjust quickly to a new environment. He is the right person for every project where such a professionalism is needed.",
